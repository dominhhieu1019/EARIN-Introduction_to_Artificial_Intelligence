## Project 1: Highway system
Prepare an algorithm that optimizes the network of highways between cities from a given set – assuming that city coordinates are given. Your solution should minimize the following objective function: 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑤<sub>1</sub>𝑡(𝑥) + 𝑤<sub>2</sub>𝑑(𝑥), where 𝑡(𝑥)- total length of highways, 𝑑(𝑥) - average length of path between two cities, and 𝑤<sub>1</sub> and 𝑤<sub>2</sub> are user provided parameters provided. 
 
Input:
- file with coordinates (𝑥<sub>𝑖</sub>, 𝑦<sub>𝑖</sub>) for all n cities,
- 𝑤<sub>1</sub>, 𝑤<sub>2</sub> – parameter values.

Output: graph describing the highway system.

## Project 2: Data mining
Work on the dataset Bike Sharing Demand from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data)
